This is the repository for the code going with the report "Analysing a two layer network in a teacher-student framework using a gaussian covariate model" made by Oscar Bouverot-Dupuis during his 2022 internship at the Statistical Physics of Computation Laboratory.
The "HOW-TO" python notebook provides everything needed to reproduce the plots in the report.
